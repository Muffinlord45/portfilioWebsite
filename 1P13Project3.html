                    <p><br>- The modelling sub-team created two concept sketches. One for the linear actuator, and one for the rotary actuator.<br><br>- Using a weighted decision matrix, we decided that the rotary design was best as it ranked the highest in the <br>matrix with the added bonus of being creative.<br><br>- By selecting the rotary design, the team showed an ability to make informed decisions that consider both quantitative and qualitative factors, which is a critical skill in the field of engineering and design.<br><br>- The decision-making process highlighted the importance of collaboration and communication within the team, as each member had valuable input that contributed to the final decision. It also emphasized the value of an inclusive and democratic approach to decision-making, where everyone's opinions and ideas are heard and considered.<br><br>- The use of a weighted decision matrix allowed the team to create an objective framework for evaluating options, which can be a useful tool in future design projects. It also provided an opportunity for the team to practice and improve their skills in data analysis and interpretation.<br><br>- Creating many concept sketches are important as it provides the opportunity to elaborate ideas and discuss with peers on <br>what can be improved, which is what we did.<em> </em>In addition, we created a list of benefits for both actuators to help us&nbsp;decide which actuator we wanted to use throughout the project.<br></p>

                    <p>[ 1 ] - After talking to some peers, they suggested that using a stick to lift the hopper up would snap as it would not be able to support the load of the hopper with trash on it.<br><br>[ 2 ] - Another problem I encountered was that the gears and axles took too long to print as the maximum print time was 2 hours.<br><br>[ 3 ] - Another problem I encountered was that the teeth of the gears were too close to each other, which would cause meshing errors when 3D printing. The teeth had to be at least 2mm apart for a successful print.<br></p>

                    <p>[ 1 ] -&nbsp; I changed the piston design to be thicker and include a guiding hole, ensuring that it can withstand such loads<br><br>[ 2 ] -&nbsp;To fix this problem, I redesigned parts to be thinner after running inventor stress simulations, minimizing mass and saving a lot of time. In the end, I was able to 3D print the parts within the design studio time slot.<br><br>[ 3 ] - To fix this problem, I reduced the number of teeth. In addition, I made the gear thinner to reduce the printing time.<br><br></p>

                    <p>- The team used feedback from various sources such as design reviews, IAI's, TA's, faculty mentors, and science students to create a refined prototype that incorporated the suggested improvements. <br><br>- Several iterations were made to optimize the performance of the refined prototype, and the team members who were not directly involved in the prototyping process took a larger role in the prototyping test plan to ensure that the final design was functional and met the required objectives.<br><br>- After creating the final physical prototype, the team presented it at another design review to receive feedback and insights on how to improve the design further and turn it from a good idea into a great idea.</p><img src="assets/img/PXL_20230228_202405532.jpg" style="border-radius: 20px;width: 700px;">

                    <p>-&nbsp; Working with a great team on a challenging project was a rewarding experience that taught me the value of clear communication. We established regular check-ins and used project management tools to keep each other up-to-date, which helped us stay on track and make timely decisions. This also allowed us to leverage our individual strengths and work more efficiently as a team.<br><br>- Embracing a growth mindset was critical in overcoming the obstacles we faced during the project. By remaining open-minded and willing to learn from our mistakes, we were able to come up with creative solutions and push beyond our limits. This attitude not only helped us achieve better results but also allowed us to build a culture of continuous learning and improvement.<br><br>- Reflecting and debriefing after each milestone helped us continuously refine our approach and make progress towards our goals. We identified what went well, what could have been improved, and how we could apply those lessons in the future. This practice not only helped us achieve better results but also allowed us to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the project's impact and potential for future growth.<br><br></p>
